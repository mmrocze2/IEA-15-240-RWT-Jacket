# IEA-15-240-RWT-Jacket
This reponsitory contains files that can be used in OpenFAST to simulate a 3-legged jacket structure in 50m water depth. These files make reference to (and therefore require) some of the files found in the IEA-15-240-RWT and IEA-15-240-RWT-Monopile folders of the IEA-25-240-RWT repository.

## Main dimensions
The 3-legged jacket model has the following main characteristics:
- Jacket footprint: 32m
- Jacket top width: 15m
- Brace heights: 13m, 15m, 17m, 20m (four bays)
- Stick-up: 4m

## Interface Elevation
The interface elevation between jacket and turbine has been increased to +30m relative to still water level (compared to +15m in the monopile model). This was considered to be more reprentative for a jacket foundation in 50m water depth.
